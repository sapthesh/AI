# Discord AI Image Bot

This repository contains a Discord bot powered by AI that provides random images based on user replies. The bot utilizes the OpenAI API to generate relevant image suggestions and fetches the images using various image APIs.

## Features

- Random Image Generation: The bot uses AI to understand user replies and generate relevant image suggestions.
- Image Fetching: The bot retrieves random images based on the generated suggestions from various image APIs.
- Customization: The bot can be customized to use different AI models or image APIs to suit your preferences.

## Prerequisites

To run the Discord AI Image Bot, you need the following:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Discord.py library
- OpenAI Python library
- API keys for image APIs (e.g., Unsplash, Pexels, Pixabay, etc.)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up your Discord bot token. Follow the Discord developer documentation to create a new bot and obtain the token.

4. Set up your image API keys. Obtain API keys from the image providers you wish to use (e.g., Unsplash, Pexels, Pixabay) and save them in the appropriate configuration file.

5. Configure the bot. Set the desired prefix, AI model, and image API settings in the configuration file.

6. Start the bot:

```shell
python bot.py
```

7. Invite the bot to your Discord server using the OAuth2 URL generated in the Discord developer portal.

## Usage

1. In your Discord server, mention the bot using the specified prefix (e.g., `!imagebot`).

2. Reply to the bot with a message indicating the type of image you want (e.g., `!imagebot cat`).

3. The bot will use AI to generate image suggestions based on your reply and fetch a random image for you.

4. Enjoy the random images generated by the bot!

## Customization

- AI Model: You can experiment with different AI models by using the OpenAI Python library. Modify the code in `bot.py` to utilize a different AI model or fine-tune the existing model.

- Image APIs: To use different image APIs, update the configuration file with the relevant API keys and modify the image fetching code in `bot.py` to fetch images from the desired API.
