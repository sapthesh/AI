## Prompt 1: Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Posts

Build a sentiment analysis model that can automatically classify the sentiment of social media posts, such as tweets or Facebook updates. Train the model to categorize posts as positive, negative, or neutral, and evaluate its performance using appropriate evaluation metrics. Consider using natural language processing techniques, machine learning algorithms, or deep learning models to accomplish this task.

## Prompt 2: Object Detection in Real-Time Video Streams

Develop an object detection system that can detect and track objects in real-time video streams. Utilize computer vision techniques and deep learning models to detect objects of interest in each frame of the video stream. Implement a bounding box around the detected objects and track their movements across frames. Consider using popular object detection frameworks such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) or Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks) for this task.

## Prompt 3: Music Generation using Recurrent Neural Networks

Train a recurrent neural network (RNN) model to generate original music compositions. Use a dataset of musical sequences to train the model and leverage the sequential nature of music. Experiment with different RNN architectures such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) and explore various techniques for conditioning the generated music based on different styles or genres.

## Prompt 4: Speech Recognition for Voice-Controlled Systems

Create a speech recognition system that can transcribe spoken words into written text. Build a deep learning model using techniques like recurrent neural networks or convolutional neural networks to process audio data and convert it into text. Train the model on a dataset of labeled speech data and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics such as word error rate or accuracy. Consider integrating the speech recognition system into a voice-controlled application or device.

## Prompt 5: Image Style Transfer using Generative Models

Implement an image style transfer system that can transform the style of an input image to match the style of a reference image. Utilize generative models like generative adversarial networks (GANs) or neural style transfer techniques to achieve this task. Experiment with different architectures and loss functions to achieve visually appealing and realistic style transfer results. Consider providing options for users to control the degree of style transfer or blend multiple styles together.
